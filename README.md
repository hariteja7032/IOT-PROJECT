# IOT-PROJECT!
project involves building an electronic safe that uses an Arduino Uno, a micro servo, resistors, an LCD, and a keypad![image](https://github.com/chethan7032/IOT-PROJECT/assets/120156862/34b2b305-3612-403d-8ee1-de7e1ab8ae7c)
The safe will be designed to allow users to input a code and then unlock the safe using a servo motor![image](https://github.com/chethan7032/IOT-PROJECT/assets/120156862/3f520f98-ac00-48d3-a56c-2763b1e7d855)
